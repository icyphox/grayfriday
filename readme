grayfriday
----------

A fork of github.com/russross/blackfriday/v2 with a few changes. Notably:

    • Em-dashes swallow spaces. For example: "Foo -- bar" becomes "Foo&mdash;bar"
      This is more typographically accurate, while allowing for cleaner looking plaintext.
    • En-dashes only between numbers. For example: "8-9 years" becomes "8ndash;9 years".
      Again, this keeps the plaintext more natural (as opposed to writing "8 - 9" years 
      in blackfriday for an en-dash).
